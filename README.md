## Usegrammer = (Super) User + Programmer &mdash; Driving Free Software Revolution 2.0

Usegrammer, is the combination of "user" and "programmer". The "superuser" is implied as all Linux users are "superuser" of their own system, and it conveys the special status as in the Tron universe.

It is made possible by Phoscript, a lightweight Forth derivative that can be implemented as a shell script within any known programming language, thus making it easier for users to make modifications to an existing program, to enhance its functionalities, as well as help project teams solve one of its most pressing problems, both in the free software and corporate world &mdash; finding manpower to sustain or expand development activities.

Underlying this is the "programming language fragmentation" problem &mdash; the emergence of mutually incompatible programming languages over the past few decades results in the fragmentation of programmer communities, reducing the number of programmers able to work on some older projects, written in older programming languages.

This seemingly intractable problem actually has a very simple solution &mdash; so simple that it usually causes disbelief in less experienced programmers, as well as dismay amongst more experienced programmers, who for better or worse, naturally invoke some kind of defense mechanisms such as, "this is new to me, so I had better attack it so as not to embarrass myself when questioned about it."

We illustrate the significance of "Usegrammers" with 2 relatively little known C++ projects:

- Open Dynamics Engine (ODE)
- Bullet Open Scene Graph (BTOSG) https://github.com/miguelleitao/btosg

ODE and BTOSG are low level physics simulation libraries that can be used in games and simulation applications.

[Phoscript Tutorials](https://github.com/udexon/Multiweb/blob/master/Phoscript_Tutorials.md) gives a list of tutorials with sample code of Phoscript implemented on various platforms and programming languages. 

[SymForth](https://github.com/udexon/SymForth) is SymEngine with Forth (Phoscript) wrapper,   &mdahs; a fast symbolic manipulation library, written in C++, now with Reverse Polish Notation support. It consists of samples of fundamental data structure and execution framework that will be deployed in the current project.
