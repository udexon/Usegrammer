# Usegrammer = (Super) User + Programmer

Usegrammer, is the combination of "user" and "programmer".

It is made possible by Phoscript, a lightweight Forth derivative that can be implemented as a shell script within any known programming language, thus making it easier for users to make modifications to an existing program, to enhance its functionalities, as well as help project team solve one of its most pressing problems &mdash; finding manpower to sustain or expand development activities.

Underlying this is the "programming language fragmentation" problem &mdash; the emergence of mutually incompatible programming languages over the past few decades results in the fragmentation of programmer communities, reducing the number of programmers able to work on some older projects, written in older programming languages.
