While we have not personally communicated with the C++ committee members concerning the adoption of templating and metaprogramming constructs in modern C++, based on how naturally they fit into the metaprogramming schemes in Phoscript, we believe the C++ commitee members could have been considering similar issues to those in Phoscript.

The examples of Phoscript words (function tokens) described in this article, `newcar:` (to create a new car in BTOSG) and `svp:` (to set viewpoint in ODE), represent a good variety of high level and low level functions in C++ 3D related libraries. We are building up these _vocabularies_ (Forth terminology for "function libraries", i.e. "collection of _words_"), with reference to modifications of Jitsi Meet project (a video conferencing app based on React Redux framework), where we have introduced 3D three.js functions:

1. Firstly, we wish to emphasize the simplicity of the Forth like Reverse Polish Notation expressions (RPNX) &mdash; although RPNX have been used in advanced systems such as Forth real time hardware systems and PDF/Postscript engine etc., we believe it is a programming language suitable for novice as well as experts, despite the lack of entry level examples as learning materials for novice in recent years, a gap that can be filled by Phoscript.

2. Secondly, due to its suitability for both novice and experts, Phoscript can be picked up by the millions of novice programmers out there, especially non-Latin speakers who make up of the majority of the world population. Further, as they gain expertise, they can still use Phoscript to develop more advanced applications or modules.

3. There should be at least 50 million dedicated gamers worldwide if we assume every 1 in 100 of the population is a gamer. Assuming 1 in 100 gamers would spend some time learning programming to make modifications to games, this gives us 500,000 gamer-programmers. These are the typical Usegrammers we describe in this article. Gamer-programmers may use Phoscript as a unified platform and programming language for all games and apps. 

4. Further, Usegrammers are not just restricted to Gamers. Phoscript is by definition as simple as Excel (spreadsheet) formulas. As such, anyone capable of using Excel can be a Phoscript Usegrammer. 

There are many starting points in Phosway applications where a Usegrammer may begin, as described in Phoscript Tutorial.

`newcar:` is a good starting point.

The next milestone that we may attempt to achieve is the following:

- create Phoscript words to control (and destroy) each of the cars created individually.

We wish to remind readers that Phoscript words should be as easy as Excel. The process by expert programmers to create Phoscript words to be used by Usegrammers also illustrates an important feature of Phoscript: hybrid API &mdash; caller function and callee function use different programming languages, to facilitate specializations of programmers. 

In contrast to hybrid API scenarios where caller function in programming languages such as Python or Java calling C++ functions, which are "many caller programming languages to one callee programming language", Phoscript functions present "one caller programming language to many callee programming languages". This hybrid API feature can be used in small teams to programmers to consolidate and streamline development. It is also scalable to large programming teams in open source projects involving hundreds or thousands of Usegrammers.

In summary, Phoscript has the following benefits:

- As simple as Excel.
- Learn one word at a time, as natural as natural human languages.
- Anyone can program.


## Conclusions

Literally millions of novice programmers (Usegrammers), with the guidance of expert programmers, can develop new modules of applications across all programming languages and frameworks using one universal script, Phoscript, one "word" (Phoscript function) at a time.

This is a big step forward from the existing free and open source software development model where programmers need to pick up a new programming language or framework before able to contribute, where Phoscript reduces the barrier of entry to the level of learning and using Excel (spreadsheet).

Furthermore, the Phosway ID-less inter-gateway payment system, PhosPay, will enable online tipping for contributions by programmers, with payments in any national currency or cryptocurrency. This will incentivize teams of free and open source programmers to work more productively, instead of the current scenarios where the programmers receive no monetary rewards or can only receive sponsorships from a very small number of free and open source project sponsors. 

With Phosway's new infrastructure, we hope to see free software programmers of the world work together to produce non proprietary versions of social networks applications and universal 3D interactive applications, simulations and games in a much shorter time (5 years) than the MAGA+F (Microsoft Apple Google Amazon Facebook) equivalent.

Beyond cloning MAGA+F applications, we believe Phosway infrastructure will finally liberate the ultimate productivity of free software programmers of the world, to the extent where corporation employed software development will no longer surpass, just like how Linux kernel development has beaten all other operating system projects, but now incentivized and facilitated by Phosway in all types of applications ever conceived by human beings.
