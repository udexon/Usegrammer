While we have not personally communicated with the C++ committee members concerning the adoption of templating and metaprogramming constructs in modern C++, based on how naturally they fit into the metaprogramming schemes in Phoscript, we believe the C++ commitee members could have been considering similar issues to those in Phoscript.

The examples of Phoscript words (function tokens) described in this article, `newcar:` (to create a new car in BTOSG) and `svp:` (to set viewpoint in ODE), represent a good variety of high level and low level functions in C++ 3D related libraries. We are building up these _vocabularies_ (Forth terminology for "function libraries", i.e. "collection of _words_"), with reference to modifications of Jitsi Meet project (a video conferencing app based on React Redux framework), where we have introduced 3D three.js functions:

1. Firstly, we wish to emphasize the simplicity of the Forth like Reverse Polish Notation expressions (RPNX) &mdash; although RPNX have been used in advanced systems such as Forth real time hardware systems and PDF/Postscript engine etc., we believe it is a programming language suitable for novice as well as experts, despite the lack of entry level examples as learning materials for novice in recent years, a gap that can be filled by Phoscript.

2. Secondly, due to its suitability for both novice and experts, Phoscript can be picked up by the millions of novice programmers out there, especially non-Latin speakers who make up of the majority of the world population. Further, as they gain expertise, they can still use Phoscript to develop more advanced applications or modules.

3. There should be at least 50 million dedicated gamers worldwide if we assume every 1 in 100 of the population is a gamer. Assuming 1 in 100 gamers would spend some time learning programming to make modifications to games, this gives us 500,000 gamer-programmers. These are the typical Usegrammers we describe in this article. 

Ultimately, we wish to ....


The varieties of incompatible Games and simulation applications illustrate perfectly the problem of programmer (programming languages and tools) fragmentation.Â 

We shall demonstrate how Phoscript may simplify the code and make it portable to other platforms.
